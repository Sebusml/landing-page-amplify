# Yet another Blog app

I created this blog app mainly to learn NextJs, React, Tailwind, Typescript, GraphQl, and AWS Amplify. As a result, some features are a little over engineered, like using a lambda function to keep the post like-counts as a computed property in DynamoDB :fire:.

## Getting Started

Install Amplify cli

```bash
$ npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
$ amplify configure
```

For more details check the [Amplify README](https://github.com/Sebusml/landing-page-amplify/tree/main/amplify).

## Running Dev

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

> Note: Amplify needs to be setup properly with a dev env activated.

## Random Notes

- The UI was inspired by different Tailwind code snippets.
- All GraphQl types, queries, mutations and subscriptions were generated by Amplify from the [schema](https://github.com/Sebusml/landing-page-amplify/blob/main/amplify/backend/api/landingpageamplify/schema.graphql).

## Amplify Commands

```bash
$ amplify add/update/remove function
$ amplify add/update/remove api
$ amplify add/update/remove auth
$ amplify push
```
